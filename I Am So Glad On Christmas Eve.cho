Norwegian:
Jeg er så glad hver julekveld,
for da ble Jesus født;
da lyste stjernen som en sol,
og engler sang så søtt.

Verse 1:
I am so glad on Christmas Eve,
The night of Jesus' birth!
Then like the sun the star shone forth,
And angels sang on earth.

Verse 2:
The little child in Bethlehem,
He was a King indeed!
For He came down from heav'n above
To help a world in need.

Verse 3:
He dwells again in heaven's realm,
The Son of God today;
And still He loves His little ones
And hears them when they pray.

Verse 4:
I am so glad on Christmas eve!
His praises then I sing;
He opens then for ev'ry child
The palace of the King.

Verse 5:
And so I love each Christmas Eve,
And I love Jesus too;
And that He loves me ev'ry day
I know so well is true.
