Verse 1:
Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o'er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echo back their joyous strains.

{soc}
Glo------ria in excelsis Deo
Glo------ria in excelsis Deo
{eoc}

Verse 2:
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be,
Which inspire your heav'nly song?

Verse 3:
3.) Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King.
